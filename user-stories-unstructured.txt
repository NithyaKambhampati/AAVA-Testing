The issue status in Jira does not update correctly after resolution and often shows outdated information until manually refreshed.

I am unable to see all bugs linked to a user story, which causes missed dependencies and late discoveries during the sprint.

Jira sometimes throws an error when transitioning an issue, but it does not provide a clear reason or guidance to fix it.

Finding high-priority or critical bugs across multiple projects is difficult because filters return inconsistent results.

Automated updates and comments on Jira tickets are unclear, making it hard to understand what exactly changed and why.

When a ticket is moved between boards or projects, important fields get reset or lost, leading to confusion and rework.
